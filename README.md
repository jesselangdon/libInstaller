# libInstaller
This is a simple Python module which accepts a Python package name, checks to see whether the package has already been installed 
with pip, and if not, installs it on the local machine using pip. Error messages are returned if the library is already installed, 
or if the package can not be found on PyPi.

libInstaller can work with either Python 2 or 3.  

libInstaller is developed and maintained by [jesselangdon](github.com/jesselangdon).
